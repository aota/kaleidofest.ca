## Message From The Artistic Director

**Christy Morin, Founder / Executive Director, Arts on the Ave Edmonton Society**

**10 years... WOW!** Kaleido is now into the double digits! I am continually amazed and thankful for all the thousands of hours that our volunteers, boards, production teams, artists, supporters, donors, family and friends 
have contributed to make Kaleido Family Arts Festival what it is today. Everything that we do is for a reason... to help people find their way, to share life together, to rebuild a community one stone at a time. This year at Kaleido, our production team has worked very hard to invite back special artists and performances that were highlights to us these past 10 years. Expect the unexpected around corners and rooftops, alleys and parks... this festival is living and breathing. It has been a privilege to encourage dialogues between artists, neighbours and businesses.

Kaleido is an artistic occupation of the Alberta Avenue Arts District - it reflects our many cultures, rituals, traditions, languages and soul. 

Thank you to each of you for finding us and making Kaleido Family Arts Festival a part of 
your lives.

Hereâ€™s to the next decade!
God Bless,

Christy Morin
P.S. - See you at the fireworks Saturday at 11:00 pm



## His Worship Mayor Don Iveson

On behalf of City Council and the people of Edmonton, Alberta's Capital City, I welcome everyone to the Kaleido Family Arts Festival.

Now in its ninth year, this festival has quickly become a local favourite for Alberta Avenue residents and visitors alike. With a wide range of art and performances on the rooftops, buildings, streets, alleys, parks and even lamp posts of Alberta Avenue, the Kaleido Festival transforms one of Edmonton's historic neighbourhoods into a living stage.

Events like this help invigorate our city's older communities, making them safer and more welcoming year-round. I thank the Arts on the Ave team and the many artists, volunteers and sponsors who make this festival possible each year. Your efforts contribute to Edmonton's reputation as a vibrant City with a thriving arts and cultural scene.

Have a fun-filled festival!

Yours truly,  
Don Iveson, Mayor


## The Honourable Heather Klimchuk

**Minister of Culture**

As minister responsible for culture, it is my great pleasure to welcome Edmontonians and visitors alike to the 2014 Kaleido Family Arts Festival.

I am proud to see growth and development of Alberta Avenue as a hub of arts and culture. This vibrancy extends throughout the neighbourhood, offering families, friends and spectators the opportunity to explore the alleys, streets and spaces filled with performers and arts. The Kaleido Festival is a great example of how a community can transform ordinary streets into a magical experience.

My thanks to Arts on the Ave for presenting this annual event and to all the performers, artists and volunteers for their invaluable contributions.

Best wishes for an enjoyable festival!

Heather Klimchuk, Minister

## The Honourable Shelly Glover

**Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages**

Our Government knows how important it is to provide our youth with opportunities to discover our country's heritage and explore the world of arts and culture. As we approach Canada's 150th birthday in 2017, we have a wonderful opportunity to help our young people discover what defines Canadian society and to encourage them to participate in it. Through its educational activities, the Kaleido Family Arts Festival provides a rewarding experience that is both entertaining and educational for the region's families.

On behalf of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Government of Canada, I would like to thank Arts on the Ave and all the organizers, performers, and volunteers who helped bring this year's Kaleido Festival to life.

The Honourable Shelly Glover
