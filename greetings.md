## Message From The Artistic Director

**Christy Morin, Founder / Executive Director, Arts on the Ave Edmonton Society**

Welcome to our 9th Kaleido Family Arts Festival. This unique festival has been built on community, passion, and creativity. Each year, this festival shares how the arts and community together bring joy, laughter and friendship to a neighbourhood that had lost vision of its beauty, history and identity. Its spirit was lost...we are thrilled to be part of the rebuilding of the Alberta Avenue District. Rebuilding takes commitment for the long haul, and I am happy to share that we are here and not leaving. Thank you to each of you, our partners, community supporters, production team, volunteers, performers, neighbours, and funders for believing with us that change starts with one smile, one volunteer hour or one coffee shared with another.

This year’s theme is Relish! Relish Kaleido! Relish your time with family and friends! Relish life on the Ave!

From our family to yours - have a wonderful time at the festival, come back and visit soon!

God Bless,  
Christy Morin



## His Worship Mayor Don Iveson

On behalf of City Council and the people of Edmonton, Alberta’s Capital City, I welcome everyone to the Kaleido Family Arts Festival.

Now in its ninth year, this festival has quickly become a local favourite for Alberta Avenue residents and visitors alike. With a wide range of art and performances on the rooftops, buildings, streets, alleys, parks and even lamp posts of Alberta Avenue, the Kaleido Festival transforms one of Edmonton’s historic neighbourhoods into a living stage.

Events like this help invigorate our city’s older communities, making them safer and more welcoming year-round. I thank the Arts on the Ave team and the many artists, volunteers and sponsors who make this festival possible each year. Your efforts contribute to Edmonton’s reputation as a vibrant City with a thriving arts and cultural scene.

Have a fun-filled festival!

Yours truly,  
Don Iveson, Mayor


## The Honourable Heather Klimchuk

**Minister of Culture**

As minister responsible for culture, it is my great pleasure to welcome Edmontonians and visitors alike to the 2014 Kaleido Family Arts Festival.

I am proud to see growth and development of Alberta Avenue as a hub of arts and culture. This vibrancy extends throughout the neighbourhood, offering families, friends and spectators the opportunity to explore the alleys, streets and spaces filled with performers and arts. The Kaleido Festival is a great example of how a community can transform ordinary streets into a magical experience.

My thanks to Arts on the Ave for presenting this annual event and to all the performers, artists and volunteers for their invaluable contributions.

Best wishes for an enjoyable festival!

Heather Klimchuk, Minister

## The Honourable Shelly Glover

**Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages**

Our Government knows how important it is to provide our youth with opportunities to discover our country’s heritage and explore the world of arts and culture. As we approach Canada’s 150th birthday in 2017, we have a wonderful opportunity to help our young people discover what defines Canadian society and to encourage them to participate in it. Through its educational activities, the Kaleido Family Arts Festival provides a rewarding experience that is both entertaining and educational for the region’s families.

On behalf of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Government of Canada, I would like to thank Arts on the Ave and all the organizers, performers, and volunteers who helped bring this year’s Kaleido Festival to life.

The Honourable Shelly Glover
