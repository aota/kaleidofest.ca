## Message From The Artistic Director

**Christy Morin, Founder / Executive Director, Arts on the Ave Edmonton Society**

My family welcomes you to Kaleido!

It takes a community to raise and nurture a festival, just as it takes a village to raise a child. We thank each of you for sharing in the beauty of the arts and our great historic neighbourhood. Thank you to our fantastic production team, sponsors, partners and phenomenal artists for your time, talents and gifts.

**This year we want to remember and give honour to Don Snider. Don was our Production Site Manager for many years. He brought incredible insight, wisdom and love to our community and team. Don “got” what Kaleido is and shared the vision with many. Don, we love you and miss
you dearly. You will always be cherished.**

Here’s to Don! Life is beautiful. Enjoy the festival.

Christy Morin



## His Worship Mayor Stephen Mandel

On behalf of City Council and the people of Edmonton, Alberta’s Capital City,  I’d like to welcome everyone attending the Kaleido Family Arts Festival.

Edmonton is proud of its exceptional arts community, and our summer festivals showcase many brilliant aspects of this community. The Kaleido Family Arts Festival will bring guests to Alberta Avenue to view more than 300 acts in a fun and interactive atmosphere. With dancers on rooftops, hip hop artists in the alley, singing, theatre and fine arts, the festival is sure to be a thrilling and colourful gathering of the season.

Thank you to Arts on the Ave for taking initiative to cultivate fellowship and community connection by promoting artistic expression in Edmonton. Your commitment to providing a canvas on which countless artists and art forms can unfold inspires the hearts and minds of many and makes our city a brighter, stronger place to live.
Best wishes for a successful festival!

Yours Truly, Stephen Mandel


## The Honourable Heather Klimchuk

**Minister of Culture**

As Minister responsible for Alberta’s vibrant culture sector, it is my great pleasure to welcome Edmontonians and visitors alike to the 2013 Kaleido Family Arts Festival.

Like a kaleidoscope uses light to transform glass into vivid, constantly changing shapes and colours, culture has the power to transform, vitalize and brighten communities, making them even better places to live, work and raise a family. Arts on the Ave and the Kaleido Family Arts Festival demonstrate this transformative power, turning Alberta Avenue into a hub for creative exploration and a stage for Albertan artists to showcase their talents.

My thanks to Arts on the Ave for presenting this annual event and to all the performers, artists and volunteers for their invaluable contributions.

Best wishes for an enjoyable festival!
