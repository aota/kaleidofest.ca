## Message From The Artistic Director

**Christy Morin, Founder / Executive Director, Arts on the Ave Edmonton Society**

**10 years... WOW!** Kaleido is now into the double digits! I am continually amazed and thankful for all the thousands of hours that our volunteers, boards, production teams, artists, supporters, donors, family and friends 
have contributed to make Kaleido Family Arts Festival what it is today. Everything that we do is for a reason... to help people find their way, to share life together, to rebuild a community one stone at a time. 

This year at Kaleido, our production team has worked very hard to invite back special artists and performances that were highlights to us these past 10 years. Expect the unexpected around corners and rooftops, alleys and parks... this festival is living and breathing. It has been a privilege to encourage dialogues between artists, neighbours and businesses.

Kaleido is an artistic occupation of the Alberta Avenue Arts District - it reflects our many cultures, rituals, traditions, languages and soul. 

Thank you to each of you for finding us and making Kaleido Family Arts Festival a part of 
your lives.

Here’s to the next decade!

God Bless,

Christy Morin

P.S. - See you at the fireworks Saturday at 11:00 pm



## The Honourable Rachel Notley

On behalf of the Government of Alberta, I am delighted to welcome you to  the 10th anniversary of the Kaleido Family Arts Festival.

Unquestionably, art impacts our daily lives. For the next 3 days it will transform the streets of Alberta Avenue into a place that awakens us, inspires  us, and delights us. This festival is all about sharing our passion for the arts with our friends, neighbours, and everyone throughout Edmonton. I hope you have the opportunity to let your creative side explore the streets of the Alberta Avenue Arts District. 

My thanks go to the organizers, volunteers, and especially the artists of this wonderful festival. Your hard work and dedication help to transform our communities into beautiful works of art. 

Rachel Notley, Premier of Alberta

## His Worship Mayor Don Iveson

On behalf of City Council and the people of Edmonton, Alberta’s Capital City, I welcome everyone to the 10th annual Kaleido Family Arts Festival.

With performance and visual arts on display in a range of unconventional venues, this festival is a free, all-ages event that makes the arts accessible to everyone. Using rooftops, back alleys, parks and other public spaces, Kaleido helps support the vibrancy and character of Alberta Avenue, preserving one of our city’s beautiful mature neighbourhoods.

I thank the many artists, performers, volunteers and sponsors who make this festival possible each year. Their passion and enthusiasm enhance our city’s arts and culture scene and help make Edmonton an exciting and uplifting place to live.

Yours truly,

Don Iveson, Mayor


## The Honourable David Eggen

**Minister of Culture**

As Minister responsible for culture and tourism, it is my great pleasure to welcome everyone to the 2015 Kaleido Family Arts Festival!

This annual festival is a great way to celebrate one of the most diverse and multicultural neighbourhoods in Edmonton. Albertans and visitors have the chance to take in the live street theatre, browse the handcrafted artisanal gifts and learn more about  heritage at the Takwakin Village. This is the tenth year of the festival and I encourage you to take the time to savour the richness of this event that has the atmosphere of a neighbourhood block party, but the values of a world-class celebration, right here in the city of festivals. 

My thanks to all of the volunteers, Arts on the Ave organizers, performers, participants and the sponsors for your continued support and contributions to the Kaleido Family Arts Festival. 

Enjoy the event!

David Eggen, Minister

## The Honourable Shelly Glover

**Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages**

This year, the Kaleido Family Arts Festival turns 10, and our Government is pleased to highlight all that it brings to Alberta’s cultural scene. Each year, the festival invites young Canadians and their families to explore the arts while having fun and expanding their knowledge. In this way, it gives our youth the opportunity to grow and take part in the life of their community. What a wonderful way to prepare them to become creative and engaged citizens who want to make their neighbourhood and their region a great place to live!

On behalf of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Government of Canada, I thank everyone at Arts on the Ave and the artists and volunteers who make Edmonton’s Kaleido Festival possible. 

Happy 10th anniversary; enjoy the festival!

The Honourable Shelly Glover
