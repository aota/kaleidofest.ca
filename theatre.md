### The Good Thief
**FRI 8pm | SAT 8pm | Rated M**
This is a one-man show that presents the tale of an un-named thug, a ‘small fish’ who takes a job that goes horribly wrong. He is meant to intimidate a man on behalf of a local crime boss, but instead the botched job leads to murder, kidnapping, and finally a desperate flee that results in unfortunate casualties and imprisonment. Though the story is violent and the protagonist brusque, the possibility of redemption is always on the horizon of this dark and fatalistic play.
Written by Conor McPherson, directed by Wayne Paquette, and featuring Frank Zotter.
