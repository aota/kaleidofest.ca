# Theatre

## The Good Thief
**FRI 8:00pm | SAT 8:00pm | Rated M**  
This is a one-man show that presents the tale of an un-named thug, a ‘small fish’ who takes a job that goes horribly wrong. He is meant to intimidate a man on behalf of a local crime boss, but instead the botched job leads to murder, kidnapping, and finally a desperate flee that results in unfortunate casualties and imprisonment. Though the story is violent and the protagonist brusque, the possibility of redemption is always on the horizon of this dark and fatalistic play.
Written by Conor McPherson, directed by Wayne Paquette, and featuring Frank Zotter.

## The Big Silly Improv Show
**FRI 11:15pm | SAT 11:15pm | Rated M | _A late night cabaret with licensed bar._**  
Rapid Fire Theatre presents Chris Craddock and Matt Alden as they thrill the assembled audience with scenes based on suggestions that the audience writes down on a slip of paper and slips into the large bowl at the front of the stage. It might be Shakespeare or a musical or a scene about room mates from Space. Who knows?

## Stories on Wheels
**SAT 12:00pm | SUN 1:15pm | Rated G (All Ages)**  
Stories on Wheels is an original street theatre act for the whole family, based on a traditional Japanese travelling storytelling show called kamishibai. Tales are brought to life by a high-energy comic performer, using picture cards displayed in a magnificent miniature wooden stage attached to the back of a bicycle. You’ve never been told a story this way, before!

## Rattle Rap Pitter Pound: Murmur and Myth, Stories and Sound
**SAT 2:00pm | SUN 3:00pm | Rated G (All Ages)**  
Join Bob Rasko, a.k.a The Drummer, as he tells three stories: A Tale of Rat, How Frog Got His Voice and Cricket and the Rumpy Bumpy Shagalaga Hoedown.

His specialty is storytelling with percussion instruments or as he likes to call it, artistically hitting things.

## The Phileas Flash Show
