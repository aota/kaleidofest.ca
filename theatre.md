## The Poetry Brothel (18+)
**Licensed Bar**
Crazy burlesque fun with a hefty dose of music, dance and spoken word, spontaneously crafted as “Poetry For Tips”. Bring a pocketful of money and enjoy a commissioned poem, written especially for you. Or sit back, relax and drink in the entertainment while you enjoy a bevvie.

## Late Night Madness! (All Ages)
**Licensed Bar**
This late night improv cabaret is a new tradition at Kaleido! See **Chris Craddock** and **Matt Alden** (stars of Rapid Fire Theatre) as they thrill the assembled audience with improvised scenes based on suggestions from the audience. It might be Shakespeare or a musical or a scene about room mates from Space. Who knows? All we know is that it will be hilarious and the bar is open!

## Heart Shaped Box (Ages 2 - 7)
This lovely, unique puppet show is a musical installation piece for children ages 2-7. It features original music, puppetry and storytelling that will take your little ones on a trip through all the colours of the rainbow. Join us as we take a journey through tiny surprising worlds! *Created by graphics designer Joanne Pearce, independent theatre artist Laura Raboud and musician Dana Wylie.*

## Mandrágora Circo (All Ages)
In this wordless children's show two clowns tell a story of humour and love in an unusual way! Using circus skills, music and unconventional instruments the love story of these two wonderful characters is revealed. This show premiered in Argentina in 2003 and has toured 16 countries, from Patagonia to Alaska since 2010. [www.mandragoracirco.com.ar](http://www.mandragoracirco.com.ar)

## The Trollsons in the Storyteller (All Ages)
Come deep into the forest as a family of trolls bring Scandinavian folklore to life. It's Grandpa Trollson's 200th birthday party, but he refuses to come out of his tree stump to celebrate! When audience participants join the action onstage, Grandpa cannot resist the power of storytelling. Join us for three truly interactive tales based on stories by Hans Christian Andersen, featuring live music, incredible masks, physical comedy, improvisation, and good old-fashioned troll trouble!
