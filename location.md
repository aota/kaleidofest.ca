## Getting to Kaleido

Kaleido Family Arts Festival is located in the heart of Edmonton's newest arts district, Alberta Avenue.

Discover the action **along 118<sup>th</sup> Ave, between 90 and 94<sup>th</sup> streets** and beyond. <!-- You can view our full venue list and map here. -->

Once you arrive it won't be difficult to find us – just look for people singing from rooftops, dancing on walls, painting on the street, decorating a lamp post or performing in a local playground. Art is everywhere at Kaleido!

<!-- ## Where to Park?
As roads are closed, you'll need to give some thought to available parking. You can find out about all of that on our road closure and parking page here. -->

## Parking at Kaleido

Kaleido takes place on the street, and this will have some effect on getting to the festival, as well as parking when you arrive. Here are some tips.

**You can park for free in the following areas:**

- St Faith's Anglican Church Parking Lot
- ATB financial parking lot
- 95th street 117<sup>th</sup> ave, south west parking lot
- Street parking down 118<sup>th</sup> Ave except for closure area (see below)

**Note: Saturday evening there is an Eskimos game, which means you cannot park on residential streets south of 118<sup>th</sup> Ave to 112<sup>th</sup> Ave in the Stadium area without a permit. You will be ticketed and/or towed.**

There are many spaces to park, but if you can walk or take transit it helps those who cannot a great deal.


## Road Closures at Kaleido

118<sup>th</sup> Ave will be closed from 90-94<sup>th</sup> Street from Friday, September 12, 2014 at 2pm until Sunday, September 14, 2014 at 8pm to make way for the Kaleido Family Arts Festival.
