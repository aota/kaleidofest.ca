## Getting to Kaleido

Kaleido Family Arts Festival is located in the heart of Edmonton's newest arts district, Alberta Avenue.

Discover the action **along 118 Ave, between 90 and 94 streets** and beyond.

Once you arrive it won't be difficult to find us – just look for people singing from rooftops, dancing on walls, painting on the street, decorating a lamp post or performing in a local playground. Art is everywhere at Kaleido!

## Parking at Kaleido

Kaleido takes place on the street, and this will have some effect on getting to the festival, as well as parking when you arrive. Here are some tips.

**You can park for free in the following areas:**

Friday Night & Sunday:

- North and south side of 118 Ave
- ATB Parking Lot (8804 – 118 Ave)
- Canadian Native Friendship Centre Parking Lot (11728 – 95 St)

Saturday:

- North side of 118 Ave
- ATB Parking Lot (8804 – 118 Ave)
- Canadian Native Friendship Centre Parking Lot (11728 – 95 St)

**Note: Please be aware that there is an Edmonton Eskimos football game on Saturday, September 12 at 6:00 pm. If you are coming by vehicle, please be aware of the parking ban on the south side of 118 Avenue. The City of Edmonton will be ticketing and towing.**

There are many spaces to park, but if you can walk or take transit it helps those who cannot a great deal.
