# Takwakin Village (Autumn Village)

**9210 â€“ 118 Avenue (North of the Community League Building)**

Autumn is a welcoming time for communities to share
the richness of their heritage and traditions. At Takwakin
Village, learn how to play traditional First Nations games,
taste home-made bannock, make a craft, play a traditional
instrument or learn the Metis Red River Jig. Visual Artist Jess
Gouchey will work with a youth team to create traditional
and contemporary fine art. Elders will be present to share
stories and teachings. Everyone is welcome to participate,
share, learn and enjoy.
