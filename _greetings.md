# Greetings

## His Worship Mayor Stephen Mandel

On behalf of City Council and the people of Edmonton, Alberta’s Capital City, I extend a warm welcome to everyone attending the Kaleido Family Arts Festival.

Now in its seventh year, the Kaleido Family Arts Festival features an eclectic line-up of music, dance, theatre, film, literary and visual arts. At its core, this festival helps cultivate artistic fellowship through arts celebrations and traditions creating opportunities for all individuals to experience the joy of artistic expression.

Thank you to Arts on the Ave Edmonton Society for your time and effort in organizing this wonderful event. You have helped enhance Edmonton’s reputation as a city rich in arts and culture.

Best wishes for an exciting and enjoyable festival!


## The Honourable Heather Klimchuk
Minister of Culture



As minister responsible for arts and culture, I am delighted to welcome performers, artists and visitors of all ages to the 7th Kaleido Family Arts Festival.

Art and culture have the power to change the ordinary into the extraordinary. Arts on the Ave and the Kaleido Family Arts Festival will turn 118th Avenue into a wondrous place to showcase the fantastic talent and ingenuity of Edmonton’s artistic community.

The festival is a delightful environment for inspirational cultural development through the displays of music, dance, literature, film and photography, just to name a few. It creates the opportunity for culture to connect us by transforming a street into a centre for creative exploration, turning strangers into friends and diverse individuals into a tightly knit community. My thanks to Arts on the Ave for presenting this annual event and to all the performers, artists and volunteers for their invaluable contributions.

Enjoy the Festival!



## The Honourable James Moore
Minister of Canadian Heritage



Welcome to the 7th Kaleido Family Arts Festival.

Our Government understands how important arts and culture are to strengthening our communities and our economy, which is why we are proud to support this festival. Kaleido is a great example of the transformative power of the arts. Whether on the street, in the park, or in the air, this event lets families experience and enjoy many diverse forms of Canadian art and culture.

On behalf of Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Government of Canada, I would like to thank all the organizers, performers and volunteers who have helped bring this year’s Kaleido to life. I would also like to send special thanks to Arts on the Ave. Your ongoing efforts help keep Edmonton colourful and creative.

Best Wishes!
