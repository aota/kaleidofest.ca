  This page is in Textile (not Markdown) because I needed to mix HMTL with one or the other and Markdown sucks for that.
  If there are any issues with this it probably just needs to be a straight HTML page.

Thank you supporters, advertisers, partners, fellow community-builders and artists for believing in the vision of Kaleido Family Arts Festival. Your generosity is sincerely appreciated.
