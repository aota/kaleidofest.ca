# Be a Kaleido Volunteer

Interested in being part of a wonderful community arts event on The Ave? At Kaleido Family Arts Festival 2015 we continue to build our team and would love to hear from you!

Download the paper [Volunteer form](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cdpedn3gem5808v/2015-KaleidoVolunteerForm.pdf?dl=0) and email your completed form to <kaleidovolunteers@gmail.com> or drop it off at the Carrot during business hours. We're looking forward to hearing from you!


## Info & Eats (bring your friends)!

Our next (and last) volunteer info dinner is only a week away! Join us on Tuesday August 18th for a delicious BBQ in the Alberta Avenue Community Garden (rear fenced space behind the community league at 9210-118 Ave). **This is our final volunteer information dinner** before our volunteer orientation on Tuesday Sept 8th.

_**Bring a friend!**_ We'll have door prizes for the individual who brings the most new volunteers - so bring your friends, family, co-workers, or even some random strangers and sign them up to help out! **We're still 150 volunteers short so we need your help!**

**Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at the Alberta Avenue Community League, 6-8 pm**
