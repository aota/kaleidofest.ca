# Donate to keep our festival growing!

**Every dollar counts! You can donate any amount to Arts on the Ave via PayPal. Your generosity is sincerely appreciated.**

Creating a free arts festival is unheard of in today’s world. So, how does Kaleido do it? With an incredible arts community, excellent supporters, super volunteers, and friends. We thank our supporters, advertisers, partners, fellow community-builders and artists for believing in the vision of Kaleido Family Arts Festival.

Our 2 and a half day festival celebrates the arts with family and encourages community members to become both artist and audience. This celebration encourages and highlights the vast pool of talented people who live and work in Alberta Avenue and surrounding communities.

The Kaleido Festival brings the arts to Alberta Avenue accessibly and affordably, and supports the artists who create, inspire and entertain. It fosters community awareness and community involvement and promotes diversity through multiculturalism and inter-generational expression.

Attracting people from the north-central communities and greater
Edmonton, the Kaleido Family Arts Festival offers all Edmontonians
the opportunity to experience and explore the richness and diversity
of Edmonton’s historic Alberta Avenue. **Help us keep going & growing!**
