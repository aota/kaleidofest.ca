## Message from the Artistic Director

**Christy Morin, Founder / Executive Director | Arts on the Ave Edmonton Society**

Kaleido Family Arts Festival believes that the arts bring great ideas and universal truths to light and to life, and that it’s important to share with others the many joys of community and exploring grand ideas. We are excited to share this weekend on Alberta Ave with you. Countless hours of phone calls, emails and conversations and much passion went into the creation of this festival.

Thank you to our production team, artists, volunteers, partners, supporters and to you, the community, for sharing this experience with us.

Enjoy the Ave and all that it brings to our great city! -- Christy Morin
