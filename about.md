# About

## Kaleido Family Arts Festival

Alberta Avenue comes alive with a free arts festival featuring music, dance, theatre, film, literary, and visual arts.

Artists collide in an environment of creative exploration and performances on rooftops, sides of buildings, back alleys, parks, old spaces and new spaces of 118 Avenue. You have to see it to believe it! Where won't an artist be?

Kaleido is produced by Arts on the Ave.
