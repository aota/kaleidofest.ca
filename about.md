# About

## Kaleido Family Arts Festival

Alberta Avenue comes alive with a free arts festival featuring music, dance, theatre, film, literary, and visual arts.

Artists collide in an environment of creative exploration and performances on rooftops, sides of buildings, back alleys, parks, old spaces and new spaces of 118 Avenue. You have to see it to believe it! Where won't an artist be?

Kaleido is produced by Arts on the Ave.

## Arts on the Ave

We are pleased to celebrate our radical tenth year with you! At its core, Arts on the Ave believes in cultivating artistic fellowship through arts celebrations, signature art festivals, and traditions. The Society's goals are to nurture creative environments and to create opportunities for everyone to experience the joy of artistic expression. Arts on the Ave is composed of visual and performance artists, literary and film artists, photographers, and musicians who collaborate and create in the 118 Avenue district between NAIT and Northlands.

The signature projects of Arts on the Ave are Kaleido Family Arts Festival, Deep Freeze: A Winter Byzantine Festival, The Carrot Community Arts Coffeehouse, and Social Art Experiences.
